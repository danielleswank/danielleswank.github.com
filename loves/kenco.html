      <h3>So what is this project?</h3>
      <p>Kenco is one of the largest family-owned and privately-held third-party logistics providers in the country. They are a very innovative company and created their first website in the 90's. The problem was that their website had been added to and added to over the years without a real plan. They reached out to my company to see what we could do. I led a full site restructuring from an IA perspective, created user flows and personas and then built the whole thing with the help of my amazing team of crack engineers and designers.</p>

      <h3>Ok cool, so what did you actually do?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Creative direction and brand style guide development.</li>
        <li>User personas. I did hours of interviews with stakeholders of different divisions to come up with several ideal users and tailored the site to them.</li>
        <li>Sorted hundreds of IA cards. Seriously, we took over a conference room table for nearly a week.</li>
        <li>Project management. My boss let me run with the project (thanks Jay). I did everything from creating a deck, to giving the initial pitch, to follow up meetings, to creative direction, to building the site with the help of my team.</li>
      </ul>
